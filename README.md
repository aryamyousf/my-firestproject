# Darb Public Riyadh Transport Mobile Application

## Project Description
This project aims to design a simplified mobile application for the Riyadh transport system.  
The application will help users plan trips, view transport route options, check arrival times, and access digital ticket information in an easy and organized way.  
The goal is to improve transportation accessibility for Riyadh residents and visitors equally.

## Project Objectives
1. To design a clear and user-friendly mobile interface.  
2. To allow users to view bus and metro routes and stations.  
3. To enable simple trip planning from one location to another.  
4. To provide multiple travel options with different functionalities.  
5. To display estimated arrival times for transport vehicles.  
6. To provide digital ticket viewing functionality.  
7. To show an interactive location map that presents all transport options clearly.  
8. To store basic user data securely.  
9. To implement local data storage for routes and user information.
